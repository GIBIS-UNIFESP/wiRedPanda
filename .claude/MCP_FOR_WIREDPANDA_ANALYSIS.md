# MCP for wiRedPanda Analysis

**Session ID**: `7d785c1d-6d5e-420f-9ae7-7bf69454b48e`  
**Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Question**: "is it possible to write an MCP so that ai models can control wiredpanda?"

## Overview

Yes, it's definitely possible to write an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server to allow AI models to control wiRedPanda! This would be a fascinating project that would enable AI assistants to programmatically create, modify, and simulate digital circuits.

## MCP Architecture for wiRedPanda

**MCP Server Components:**
- **Circuit Builder**: Create/modify digital logic circuits
- **Simulation Controller**: Start/stop/step simulation 
- **Element Manager**: Add gates, wires, inputs, outputs
- **State Inspector**: Read circuit state, probe signals
- **File Operations**: Load/save .panda files

## Implementation Approaches

### 1. CLI-based MCP Server
```bash
# Example tools the MCP could expose:
wiredpanda --headless --load circuit.panda --simulate --output results.json
wiredpanda --create --add-gate AND --connect 1,2 --save new_circuit.panda
```

### 2. Library Integration MCP
- Link against wiRedPanda's Qt libraries
- Direct programmatic control of Scene, Elements, Simulation classes
- Real-time circuit manipulation

### 3. IPC-based MCP
- Communicate with running wiRedPanda instance
- JSON/pipe-based command protocol
- Hot-reload circuits in GUI

## Key MCP Tools to Implement

- `create_circuit()` - Start new circuit
- `add_element(type, position)` - Add gates/components  
- `connect_ports(from, to)` - Wire elements
- `set_input_value(element_id, value)` - Control inputs
- `run_simulation(steps)` - Execute simulation
- `get_output_values()` - Read results
- `save_circuit(filename)` - Persist design
- `load_circuit(filename)` - Load existing design

## Use Cases

### Educational
- AI tutors teaching digital logic
- Interactive circuit building lessons
- Automated problem generation and verification

### Circuit Design
- AI-assisted optimization
- Design pattern recognition and suggestions
- Automated circuit generation from specifications

### Testing
- Automated verification of designs
- Comprehensive test case generation
- Regression testing for circuit modifications

### Documentation
- AI generating circuit explanations
- Automatic documentation of circuit behavior
- Interactive circuit exploration

## Technical Foundation

The existing codebase has excellent foundations for MCP integration:

- **Element/Scene Architecture**: Well-structured component system
- **Headless Simulation Capability**: Already supports non-GUI operation
- **Comprehensive Serialization**: Robust save/load functionality
- **CLI Interface**: Existing command-line options for automation

### Existing CLI Capabilities Discovered

During research phase, the following CLI capabilities were identified in `main.cpp`:

**Export Operations:**
- `--arduino-file` / `-a`: Exports circuit to Arduino code
- `--waveform` / `-w`: Exports circuit to waveform text file
- `--terminal` / `-c`: Exports circuit to waveform with terminal input
- `--inspect` / `-i`: Prints all inputs and outputs with current values

**Configuration Options:**
- `--verbosity` / `-v2`: Verbosity level 0-5 for debugging
- `--blockTruthTable` / `-btt`: Block execution if circuit contains Truth Tables
- File loading: Positional argument for circuit file to open

**Headless Operation:**
- Application can run without GUI for export/analysis operations
- Supports programmatic circuit loading and processing
- Built-in inspection capabilities for circuit state

### Wireless Connection Architecture

The research also revealed the current wireless connection implementation:

**WirelessConnectionManager Class:**
- Hash-based storage: `QHash<Node*, QString> m_nodeLabels`
- Group management: `QHash<QString, QSet<Node*>> m_labelGroups` 
- Signal-based updates with `wirelessConnectionsChanged()` notifications
- Comprehensive serialization support
- Debug utilities for connection inspection

**Signal Propagation:**
- Simulation class handles wireless signal updates via `updateWirelessConnections()`
- Priority-based signal resolution (Active signals take precedence)
- Integration with existing Scene/Node architecture
