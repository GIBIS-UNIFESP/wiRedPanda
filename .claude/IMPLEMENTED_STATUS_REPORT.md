**Status**: Complete implementation with exact code matches

**✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED:**
- **SR Latch Logic Correction**: Exact implementation found in `app/logicelement/logicsrlatch.cpp`
  ```cpp
  if (S && R) {
      // Forbidden state S=1, R=1: Reset-dominant behavior 
      q0 = false;  // Q = 0 (reset state)
      q1 = true;   // Q̄ = 1 (complementary)
  }
  ```
- **D Flip-Flop Preset/Clear Conflict Resolution**: Exact implementation found in `app/logicelement/logicdflipflop.cpp`
  ```cpp
  if (!prst && !clr) {
      // Both preset and clear active: Clear has priority (reset-dominant)
