# Partially-Implemented Analysis Report
*Assessment of Implementation Status for 8 Strategic Planning Documents*

## Executive Summary

Analysis of the 8 markdown files in `partially-implemented/` reveals a **mixed implementation landscape** where significant testing infrastructure has been built, but major architectural refactoring plans remain largely unimplemented. The project shows **strong progress in testing coverage** while **structural improvements remain as aspirational plans**.

## üîÑ **PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION** (3 files)

### 3. **COVERAGE_IMPROVEMENT_PLAN.md** - 40% Implemented üîÑ

**‚ùå REMAINING:**
- Full Adder hierarchy (Half-Adder ‚Üí Full Adder ‚Üí 4-bit Adder progression)
- ALU components (Subtractor, Comparator, Basic ALU)
- Advanced memory hierarchy (D-Latch from gates, Register file)
- Control logic (State machines, Sequence detectors)
- Advanced data path (Barrel shifter, Priority encoder)

**Assessment**: **Foundation established** but advanced hierarchical progression missing.

### 5. **IC_SIMPLIFICATION_ANALYSIS.md** - 15% Implemented üîÑ
**Status**: Analysis complete, architectural changes not implemented

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:**
- Comprehensive analysis of 15+ IC special case branches across 8 files ‚úÖ
- Detailed documentation of architectural inconsistencies ‚úÖ
- Polymorphism improvement strategies identified ‚úÖ

**‚ùå REMAINING:**
- No actual code refactoring visible
- Special case branches still exist: confirmed 1 FIXME in `app/graphicelement.h`
- IC class still has extensive special handling throughout codebase
- Liskov Substitution Principle violations remain unaddressed

**Assessment**: **Excellent analysis, zero implementation** - remains a strategic plan.

## ‚ùå **MINIMAL IMPLEMENTATION** (3 files) 

### 6. **COMPREHENSIVE_REFACTORING_PLAN.md** - 10% Implemented ‚ùå
**Status**: Critical issues unresolved, architectural improvements not started

**‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED:**
- Analysis and documentation of technical debt ‚úÖ
- Identification of God class anti-patterns ‚úÖ

**‚ùå REMAINING:**
- **Critical FIXME unresolved**: "connecting more than one source makes element stop working" still exists
- **God classes unchanged**: MainWindow (1,749 lines), BewavedDolphin (1,439 lines), Scene (1,267 lines), GraphicElement (1,214 lines)
- **Grid rendering optimization missing**: No QPixmap optimization found in `app/scene.cpp`
- **Dependency injection not implemented**: Singleton patterns remain

## üéØ **Key Insights**

### **What Got Implemented:**
1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test suites for memory circuits, serialization, and Arduino code generation
2. **Bug Validation**: Critical memory circuit logic bugs were fixed and validated with tests  
3. **Coverage Expansion**: Zero-coverage areas (Arduino, memory circuits) now have substantial test coverage

### **What Remains as Plans:**
1. **Architectural Refactoring**: God classes, dependency injection, and design patterns remain unchanged
2. **Code Quality**: Raw pointers, inconsistent error handling, and performance bottlenecks unresolved
3. **Simplification**: Logic gate templating, dead code removal, and LOC reduction not implemented
4. **Critical Bugs**: Multi-source connection FIXME still exists in production code

### **Strategic Recommendation:**
The project successfully **validates existing functionality** through comprehensive testing but has not **modernized its architecture**. Future effort should focus on the substantial refactoring plans that remain unimplemented to address technical debt and maintainability concerns.
