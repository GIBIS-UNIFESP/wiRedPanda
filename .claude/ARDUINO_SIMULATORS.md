# Arduino Simulators for wiRedPanda Export Testing

This document outlines various Arduino simulators that can be used to test wiRedPanda's export functionality without requiring physical hardware.

## Web-Based Simulators

### Wokwi (https://wokwi.com)
**Best overall choice for testing exported code**

- Excellent debugging tools with serial monitor
- Large library of virtual components (LEDs, buttons, sensors, displays)
- Can import code directly via copy-paste
- Real-time simulation with waveform visualization
- Active community and good documentation
- Supports custom libraries and advanced features

**Cons:**
- Requires internet connection
- Free tier has project limits (paid plans available)
- Some advanced/exotic components may not be available
- Performance depends on browser and internet speed

**Limitations:**
- Cannot simulate exact timing of real hardware
- Some Arduino-specific edge cases may not be captured
- Limited to supported component library

### Tinkercad Circuits (https://tinkercad.com)
**Good for beginners and educational use**

**Pros:**
- Completely free with Autodesk account
- Very user-friendly interface
- Good for basic Arduino projects
- Integrated with Tinkercad's 3D modeling tools
- Educational tutorials and examples
- No software installation needed

**Cons:**

- Basic simulation capabilities
- Less advanced debugging features
- Primarily targeted at education/beginners

**Limitations:**
- Cannot handle complex projects or advanced libraries
- Limited Arduino board support (mainly Uno)
- No advanced timing or interrupt simulation
- Basic serial monitor functionality

## Desktop Simulators

### SimulIDE
**Best for circuit visualization and hardware interaction**

**Pros:**
- Free and open source
- Supports Arduino and other microcontrollers (PIC, AVR, etc.)
- Excellent circuit visualization with schematic view
- Real-time voltage/current monitoring
- Supports both code simulation and circuit design
- Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, macOS)
- No internet connection required

**Cons:**
- Requires installation and setup
- Steeper learning curve than web simulators
- Documentation can be sparse
- Updates less frequent than commercial alternatives

**Limitations:**
- Component library smaller than specialized tools
- Some Arduino libraries may not be fully supported
- Performance can be slow with complex circuits
- User interface less polished than commercial options

### Proteus (ISIS/ARES)
**Professional-grade simulation**

**Pros:**
- Industry-standard simulation accuracy
- Comprehensive component libraries
- Advanced analysis tools (oscilloscope, logic analyzer)
- Supports mixed-mode simulation (analog + digital)
- Excellent for professional development

**Cons:**
- Expensive commercial license required
- Complex interface with steep learning curve
- Overkill for simple Arduino testing
- Windows-only (officially)

**Limitations:**
- Cost prohibitive for casual testing
- Requires significant time investment to learn
- May be too complex for testing simple exported code

## Command-Line Tools

### simavr
**Lightweight command-line AVR simulator**

**Pros:**
- Very lightweight and fast
- Accurate AVR instruction simulation
- Can run compiled hex files directly
- Good for automated testing
- Open source and free

**Cons:**
- Command-line only (no GUI)
- Requires compilation of Arduino sketches to hex
- No visual component simulation
- Technical expertise required

**Limitations:**
- No visual feedback for LEDs, displays, etc.
- Limited to basic I/O simulation
- Requires knowledge of AVR toolchain
- Not suitable for interactive testing

### Arduino CLI with Simulator Backends
**Official Arduino tooling**

**Pros:**
- Official Arduino support
- Integrates with existing Arduino toolchain
- Good for CI/CD testing pipelines
- Free and open source

**Cons:**
- Limited simulation capabilities
- Primarily for compilation/upload testing
- No visual component simulation
- Requires technical setup

**Limitations:**
- Not a true hardware simulator
- Cannot test hardware interactions
- Mainly useful for code compilation verification

## Recommendations for wiRedPanda Testing

### Primary Recommendation: **Wokwi**
- Best balance of features, ease of use, and accuracy
- Can quickly test exported code functionality
- Good component library for basic to intermediate projects
- Excellent debugging tools for troubleshooting

### Secondary Option: **SimulIDE**
- Good if you prefer desktop applications
- Better for understanding circuit behavior
- Useful if testing more complex hardware interactions

### For Simple Code Verification: **Tinkercad**
- Quick and easy for basic functionality testing
- Good for educational demonstrations
- Sufficient for simple logic circuits

## Testing Strategy

1. **Start with Wokwi** for initial code verification
2. **Use SimulIDE** if you need to visualize circuit behavior
3. **Fall back to Tinkercad** for simple demonstrations
4. **Consider Proteus** only if professional-grade accuracy is required

## Limitations of All Simulators

- **Timing accuracy**: No simulator perfectly matches real hardware timing
- **Library support**: Some Arduino libraries may not work in simulation
- **Hardware-specific behavior**: Real-world electrical characteristics not fully modeled
- **Performance**: Simulation is typically slower than real hardware
- **Edge cases**: Uncommon hardware behaviors may not be captured
