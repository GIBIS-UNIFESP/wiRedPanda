## Style Guide

To maintain consistency, follow these guidelines:
- **C++**: Use consistent indentation (4 spaces) and adhere to modern C++ practices.
- **Qt**: Prefer Qt's APIs and conventions over standard C++ when applicable.
- **Git Commits**: Write clear commit messages, e.g., `Fix: Resolved crash on loading large circuits`.

### Example Commit Message Format:
Fix: Corrected circuit rendering bug

The rendering pipeline for large circuits caused a crash due to unhandled edge cases. This fix ensures proper handling.
