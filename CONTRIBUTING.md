## Development Setup

### Using Development Container (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is using our development container:

1. **Prerequisites**: Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Setup**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/GIBIS-UNIFESP/wiRedPanda.git
   cd wiRedPanda
   code .
   ```

3. **Open in Container**: When prompted, select "Reopen in Container" or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

4. **Build and Test**:
   ```bash
   cmake --preset release
   cmake --build --preset release --target wiredpanda
   ctest --test-dir build
   ```

### Local Development Setup

If you prefer local development, see our detailed [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) instructions for your platform.

**Quick Start (Linux/macOS)**:
```bash
# Install dependencies (example for Ubuntu)
sudo apt install build-essential qtbase5-dev qtmultimedia5-dev libqt5svg5-dev

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/GIBIS-UNIFESP/wiRedPanda.git
cd wiRedPanda
cmake --preset release
cmake --build --preset release
```

## Code Style Guidelines

### General Requirements
- **C++ Standard**: C++20
- **Build System**: CMake 3.16+ with Ninja generator (auto-selected)
- **Trailing Newlines**: All source files must end with a trailing newline
- **Line Trimming**: Remove trailing whitespace from all lines
- **File Types**: Apply style to `.cpp`, `.h`, `.cmake`, `CMakeLists.txt`, etc.

### Code Organization
- **Build Directory**: Always use `build/` directory to prevent accidental commits
- **Header Guards**: Use pragma once or include guards
- **Naming**: Follow Qt naming conventions for consistency

### Copyright Headers
Add copyright headers to new files:
```cpp
/*
 * Copyright (C) 2025 - [Your Name]
 *
 * This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
 * it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
 * the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
 * (at your option) any later version.
 */
```

## Testing

wiRedPanda uses Qt Test framework with CTest integration.

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
ctest --test-dir build

# Run with verbose output
ctest --test-dir build --verbose

# Run specific test pattern
ctest --test-dir build -R testcommands

# Run individual test executable
./build/testelements
./build/testfiles
```

### Test Coverage
Enable coverage analysis during development:
```bash
cmake --preset coverage
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build
```

### Sanitizers
Use sanitizers to catch bugs early:
```bash
# Address Sanitizer
cmake --preset asan

# Thread Sanitizer
cmake --preset tsan

# UB Sanitizer
cmake --preset ubsan
```

### Writing Tests
- Create test files in the `test/` directory
- Use Qt Test framework (`QTEST_MAIN`, `QVERIFY`, etc.)
- Test both positive and negative cases
- Include edge cases and error conditions

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting
1. **Check Issues**: Look for existing issues or create one to discuss your changes
2. **Follow Style**: Ensure code follows our style guidelines
3. **Test Thoroughly**: Run all tests and add new tests for your changes
4. **Update Documentation**: Update relevant documentation and comments

### Creating a Pull Request
1. **Fork and Branch**: Create a feature branch from `master`
2. **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commits
3. **Small Changes**: Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized
4. **Description**: Provide clear description of changes and motivation

### Example Commit Message
```
feat: add 16-segment display component

- Implement new display element with 16 segments
- Add corresponding tests and documentation
- Update element palette and resources

Fixes #123
```

### Review Process
- PRs require review from maintainers
- Address feedback promptly and professionally
- Automated checks (build, tests, coverage) must pass
- Maintain clean commit history

## Issue Reporting

### Bug Reports
When reporting bugs, please include:
- **Environment**: OS, Qt version, wiRedPanda version
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Clear, step-by-step instructions
- **Expected vs Actual**: What should happen vs what actually happens
- **Screenshots/Files**: Visual aids and sample circuit files if applicable
- **Logs**: Any error messages or crash logs

## Translation

wiRedPanda supports multiple languages through our translation system.

### Using Weblate (Recommended)
1. Visit our [Weblate project](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/wiredpanda/wiredpanda)
2. Select your language or request a new one
3. Translate strings using the web interface
4. Translations are automatically submitted as pull requests

### Manual Translation
1. Find translation files in `app/resources/translations/`
2. Copy `wpanda_en.ts` to `wpanda_[language_code].ts`
3. Use Qt Linguist or edit XML directly
4. Test your translation in the application
5. Submit a pull request

### Translation Guidelines
- **Context**: Understand the UI context before translating
- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology throughout
- **Length**: Consider UI space constraints
- **Cultural**: Adapt to local conventions where appropriate

## Documentation

### Types of Documentation
- **User Documentation**: README files, tutorials, help content
- **Developer Documentation**: Code comments, API docs, contributing guides
- **Educational Materials**: Learning resources, examples, lesson plans

### Documentation Standards
- **Clarity**: Write clearly and concisely
- **Accuracy**: Keep information up-to-date
- **Multilingual**: Consider translation for user-facing docs
- **Examples**: Include practical examples and code snippets

### API Documentation
We use Doxygen for API documentation:
```cpp
/**
 * @brief Brief description of the function
 * @param parameter Description of parameter
 * @return Description of return value
 */
```
