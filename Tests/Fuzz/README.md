# Fuzzing wiRedPanda

A libFuzzer harness suite targeting wiRedPanda's binary parsers (`.panda`,
`.dolphin`, the clipboard stream, and embedded/file-backed IC blobs) and the
stateful subsystems reachable from a loaded circuit (code generation,
undo/redo). Every harness is Clang-only and built under AddressSanitizer +
UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer so that memory-safety and UB bugs abort the run on
inputs no human would hand-write.

## Harnesses

Twelve harnesses, registered in `CMakeLists.txt` under `if(ENABLE_FUZZER)`:

| Binary             | Source                | Target |
|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| `fuzz_deserialize` | `FuzzDeserialize.cpp` | The full `File > Open` path: `readPreamble` → `deserializeBlobRegistry` → `deserialize` element/connection loop. Ships a structure-aware custom mutator that keeps the corpus parseable. |
| `fuzz_ic_blob`     | `FuzzICBlob.cpp`      | `IC::loadFromBlob` directly (raw bytes + a structured path that builds a valid IC with boundary elements). |
| `fuzz_structured`  | `FuzzStructured.cpp`  | `deserialize` again, but `FuzzedDataProvider` synthesises valid `.panda` structure so the budget goes to semantic content, not recovering magic bytes. |
| `fuzz_waveform`    | `FuzzWaveform.cpp`    | beWavedDolphin `.dolphin` files: `readDolphinHeader` + `DolphinSerializer::loadBinary`. |
| `fuzz_clipboard`   | `FuzzClipboard.cpp`   | Clipboard MIME slots + the copy/paste serialize→deserialize round-trip. |
| `fuzz_old_format`  | `FuzzOldFormat.cpp`   | The pre-4.1 flat binary path (`GraphicElement::loadOldFormat`) and its per-version / per-element-type branches. |
| `fuzz_ic_registry` | `FuzzICRegistry.cpp`  | `ICRegistry` blob lifecycle: `setBlob`/`hasBlob`/`blob`, `initEmbeddedIC`, and `embeddedICs` metadata loading. |
| `fuzz_codegen`     | `FuzzCodeGen.cpp`     | The Arduino + SystemVerilog exporters (only reachable via `File > Export`), plus `generateTestbench`. |
| `fuzz_round_trip`  | `FuzzRoundTrip.cpp`   | The save side: `Serialization::serialize` + every element `save()`, then re-loads the output to surface save/load asymmetries. |
| `fuzz_ic_file`     | `FuzzICFile.cpp`      | File-backed IC loading (`IC::loadFromFile` → `loadFileDirectly`), including cycle detection and old-format migration. |
| `fuzz_copy_panda`  | `FuzzCopyPanda.cpp`   | The `Save As` helpers `copyPandaFile` + `readPreamble`, including the `fileBackedICs` recursive copy + cycle guard. |
| `fuzz_undo`        | `FuzzUndo.cpp`        | The undo/redo command system (`Commands.cpp`): applies a random command sequence, then winds the stack fully back and forward. |

Each `Fuzz*.cpp` opens with a `\file \brief` block describing its strategy and
input layout — read that before triaging a finding from it.

## Build

Clang is required (libFuzzer is a Clang-only feature):

```bash
cmake --preset fuzzer
cmake --build --preset fuzzer
```

This produces `build-fuzzer/fuzz_*`, each instrumented with libFuzzer +
AddressSanitizer + UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.

## Seed corpus

Bootstrap a corpus from the project's example circuits — real `.panda` files
spanning every file-format version we still support, which gives the fuzzer a
wide, well-formed starting point to mutate from:

```bash
./Tests/Fuzz/build-seed-corpus.sh build-fuzzer/seed-corpus
```

`fuzz_ic_blob` runs against a second corpus of the inner sub-circuit `.panda`
files under `Tests/Integration/IC` — the run scripts build it automatically at
`build-fuzzer/seed-corpus-ic` on first use. `panda.dict` feeds libFuzzer the
magic header, version tokens, QVariant type IDs, and map keys so mutation
threads the format's length-prefixed fields.

## Run

Two wrappers cover the common cases; both wire up the corpus, dictionary, RSS
limit, and the LSan suppressions file for you.

```bash
# Campaign: all harnesses in the background, findings logged not fatal.
# Args: [build-dir] [workers] [harness]   (harness defaults to "all")
./Tests/Fuzz/run-unattended.sh build-fuzzer 4 all
tail -f build-fuzzer/fuzz_deserialize.log     # watch
pkill -f fuzz_                                 # stop all

# Triage: one harness, single-process, ASan/UBSan stack traces inline,
# exits on the first crash. Args: [harness] [iterations] [max-time] [build-dir]
./Tests/Fuzz/run-debug.sh deserialize 5 1800
```

To drive a single harness by hand instead:

```bash
ASAN_OPTIONS=abort_on_error=1:halt_on_error=1 \
UBSAN_OPTIONS=print_stacktrace=1:halt_on_error=1 \
LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=Tests/lsan_suppressions.txt \
./build-fuzzer/fuzz_deserialize \
    -max_total_time=600 -rss_limit_mb=2048 -dict=Tests/Fuzz/panda.dict \
    -workers=4 -jobs=4 \
    build-fuzzer/seed-corpus
```

Findings land in `build-fuzzer/findings/` (or the current directory for a
hand-run harness):
- `crash-<sha1>` — ASan/UBSan abort (real memory or UB bug, must fix).
- `oom-<sha1>` — `-rss_limit_mb` exceeded. An unbounded allocation path
  (e.g. an attacker-controlled count with no upper bound). Not a memory-safety
  bug per se, but a denial-of-service vector worth reviewing.
- `leak-<sha1>` — LSan-detected leak that survived the harness teardown.
- `timeout-<sha1>` — `-timeout` exceeded (e.g. a pathological undo/redo loop).

## Triage a crash

To re-run a single crashing input under inline stack traces:

```bash
./build-fuzzer/fuzz_deserialize build-fuzzer/findings/crash-<sha1>
```

Once the bug is understood and fixed, minimise the reproducer
(`-minimize_crash=1`), drop it under `Tests/Fuzz/regressions/`, and pin it with
a regression test in `Tests/Unit/Serialization/TestSerialization.cpp` (see the
"libFuzzer Regressions" section there for the pattern).

## Corpus maintenance

After a campaign, cross-pollinate and minimise the corpora so each harness
keeps only the inputs that add coverage for it:

```bash
./Tests/Fuzz/merge-corpora.sh build-fuzzer
```

## Coverage

To see which `App/` lines the corpus never reaches, build the coverage preset
(source-based instrumentation, no sanitizers) and render an HTML report:

```bash
cmake --preset fuzzer-coverage
cmake --build --preset fuzzer-coverage
./Tests/Fuzz/coverage-report.sh build-fuzzer-coverage
# open build-fuzzer-coverage/coverage-report/index.html
```

## Regression corpus

`regressions/` holds minimised reproducers for crashes/OOMs/timeouts this suite
has found. The contract under a fix: `load()` must throw cleanly or succeed —
never abort. Under ASan a reintroduced UAF aborts the test process, which is the
failure signal.

All reproducers have been re-verified clean against the current tree (no
crash/OOM/leak/timeout under ASan+UBSan).

`Status`:
- **pinned** — guarded by a dedicated regression test that loads the fixture and
  asserts it is rejected before allocation (OOM) or loads/throws without an ASan
  abort (UAF/UB). Tests live in `TestSerialization.cpp` (`testFuzzRegression*`)
  and `TestDolphinSerializer.cpp` (`.dolphin` header), run on every sanitizer CI
  lane via `ctest`.
- **harness-mitigated** — not a memory/correctness bug, so there is no product
  invariant to pin. `bugJ` is the only one: `TruthTable`'s 2048-bit key makes
  `UpdateCommand` serialization inherently multi-second, so `FuzzUndo` excludes
  `TruthTable` from its add/morph types. The reproducer is retained as
  documentation of why that exclusion exists.
